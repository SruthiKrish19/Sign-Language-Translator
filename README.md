A Sign language interpreter must be fluent in SL it translates, which combines signing, finger spelling, and specific body language.
  This SLT is an easy, efficient and accurate mechanism which uses computerized digital image processing & classification methods. Accurate image recognition using advanced tools (Open CV) & techniques (Convolution Neural Network). This works by interpreting three dimensional spaces in movements between hands and other parts of the body. This project Extracts features(key points) , builds model , predicts sign and generates text / speech as output. Hence providing an efficient interface for communication between the disabled and others.
